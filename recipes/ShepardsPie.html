    <h1> Shepherd's Pie</h1>
    <img src="../images/pie.jpg">
    <h3>Desciption</h3>
    <p>Shepherd’s pie consists of a meat-based filling with vegetables that is topped off with mashed potatoes and then baked in a pie casserole dish.The unique concept of Shepherd’s pie is that when it was created, the ingredients, outside of lamb and potatoes, were based on what was available.  If you go to 10 different Irish pubs, you’re going to get 10 different versions of Shepherd’s Pie.  I tell you this because while this recipe is absolutely delicious, you can tailor it to make it your own.</p>
